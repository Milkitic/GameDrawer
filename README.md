### Useful tips:
* You can open the game folder and create drawer by pressing sync button after creating folders by windows explorer.
* You can add icon for all drawers and programs.
* You can add running parameters and host programs for drawers and single program. (%APPPATH% represents the file path) (e.g. roms as games need emulator to run)
### Migarate from old "RomManager":
Run GameMigrate.exe, and follow the instructions.
### Plans:
* Add float window.
* Add recent played.
* Customize background for each drawer.
* Add screenshot for games.
* Try to get instructions of program from internet.
